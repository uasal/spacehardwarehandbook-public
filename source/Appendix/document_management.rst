Document management has long been recognized as key to success of high reliability systems, e.g.:

Word documents are stored in binary format and thus limit the utility of text based automation tools such as git. Word (docx) an however be a convenient document drafting tool and many legacy documents exist in docx or similar formats. To convert an existing docx file to markdown or restructured text, `pandoc <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>`_ is a commonly used command line tool. One downside of pandoc, when media files are extracted, the filenames are the same. this can be mitigated by extracting the images to a unique folder as, shown in the example below:

``pandoc my_document.docx -o my_document.rst --extract-media=my_doc_images``

Pandoc does not support markdown, but there is a less well supported pptx2md tool that shows prmnise: https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md
