Considerations for design for launch survival

Sufficient design factors of safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Steward Observatory has adopted a baseline factors of safety (FOS) and multiplicitve model uncertainty factors (MUF), :download:`available here <_static/attachments/SO_FOS_Table-V1_0.pdf>`.

Simple rule-of-thumb for small assemblies:

.. line-block::

    The RMS vibration amplitudes were applied as a simulated 100g static load applied along each axis simultaneously. This load was chosen to be more conservative than the requirements of the NASA General Environmental Verification Specification (GEVS) which represents a 3-sigma case of applied acceleration due to launch- induced vibrations.
