Material Selection
-------------------

18-8 stainless steel is low-cost and corrosion resistant, the strength of 70,000 psi is close to `SAE Grade 2 bolts <https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/steel-bolts-sae-grades-d_1426.html>`__. A-286 Alloy is comparable strength to non-stainless bolts, but at a relatively higher cost. The minimum tensile strength of A-286 screws typically exceed SAE Grade 8.

When a single bolt can't fail, a certified A286 alloy bolt is often called for. When there is redundancy and margin, more widely available 18-8 is often more convenient and cost effective.

For potential flight project, materials and fastener certifications should always be procured out of an aboundance of caution.


No-go Materials:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Without extensive review and waiver processses the following materials should not be used on space flight hardware:

- Cadmium (volatile and can lead to tin whiskers) [1]_
- Zinc (same as Cadmium)
- Carbon steel (corrodes in low-earth orbit and/or in salty launch locations)

Style selection
-----------------

Vented Socket Head Screws increase cost and decrease choices but allow venting of blind holes to prevent gas build up in space/vacuum applications when the hole is not otherwise vented (the smallest screw hole that must be vented is somewhat fuzzy, but the fewer unvented holes the better).

Lubricant
-----------

Lubricants that are vacuum safe and low-outgassing (see `<outgassing.nasa.gov>`__), such as Braycote 601 EF can decrease the risk of galling.

Torque
--------

For detailed calculations and requirements see NASA Standard 5020. :download:`NASA Tech Memo 19960012183 <_static/attachments/19960012183.pdf>` introduces preloaded joints and also has a table of suggested torque values.

*The quick and approximate approach for non-critical estimates*: Look up fastener clamping load and recommended torque on a table like the :download:`Spaenaur Suggested Tightening <_static/attachments/spaenaur - Suggested Tightening Torque1 Values To Produce Cor.pdf>` chart, taking care to use the lubricated column if applicable, and 18-8 bolts approximated as Grade 2 and A-286 approximated as Grade 8. The clamping load of the part should exceed the expected load on the joint being supported by a safety factor. e.g. a kilogram part expecting to see 30 g loads should and a minimum safety factor of three should be held with at least ``1 [kg]*3*(30*9.8) m/s/s = 882 Newtons`` (e.g. >198 lbs-force).

Torque wrenches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- torque wrenches should be calibrated and from a reputable supply chain and manufacturer
- torque values typically don't include the running torque and this will need to be estimated for the most accurate value.

Inserts
--------

Inserts, such as locking helical inserts, provide a locking mechanism to prevent screws from backing out, can add strength, and increase the tolerable number of cycles of a joint. To prevent galling, mil-spec Nitronic 60, keyed or helical ("helicoils"), inserts are required whenever practical. Locking inserts are preferred when the number of cycles is expected to be low.

Staking
---------

See NASA standard 5020 section ``B.5 Best Practices for Adhesive Locking Features``.

At a minimum, a small amount of adhesive (i.e. 2216 B/A Gray) applied to the clean interface of the head of a screw to the bearing material is recommended to provide secondary retention.
